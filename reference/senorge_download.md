# Download SeNorge2018 data

This function downloads the files as queried by
[`metnordic_buildquery()`](https://moritzshore.github.io/miljotools/reference/metnordic_buildquery.md).
If you do not pass a `directory`, files will be downloaded in the
working directory. You have the option of downloading the following
SeNorge2018 variables at daily resolution:

- `tn` (minimum daily temperature in Celsius)

- `tx` (maximum daily temperature in Celsius)

- `rr` (sum daily precipitation in mm),

- `tg` (mean daily temperature in Celsius) If you do not provide a
  vector of variables to download, all will be downloaded. You can also
  provide a `polygon` (Georeferenced simple feature, the same that you
  provided to
  [`metnordic_coordwindow()`](https://moritzshore.github.io/miljotools/reference/metnordic_coordwindow.md))
  to verify that the download is covering your desired area.
