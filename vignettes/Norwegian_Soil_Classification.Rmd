## Introduction

Classifies soils based off of clay, silt, sand fractions using USDA or Norwegian systems.

Reads in soil clay, silt, sand fractions and returns soil classification based
on USDA or Norwegian definitions.


```{r, fig1, echo= FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 1: Soil classificatio based on the Norwegian (left) and USDA (right) systems.", out.width="50%", out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/soil_class.png")
```
The function has the following features:

- Automatically Compatible with csv or xlsx. Tries to automatically guess format of data, and acts accordingly.

- Automatically rounds total fraction to 100%, if differences are under 1%.

- Exports classification based on user settings

- Creates an interactive diagnostic plot, as well as saving one to output directory.

Note: the script will automatically try to identify which columns contain the
clay, silt, sand fractions and also try to identify which format they are in. If
this does not work, you might get incorrect or flawed results, so make sure to
**READ what THE CONSOLE prints out**, to make sure it did the correct things.
If the script cannot read your file automatically, then the following format is
recommended:

- Clay column: "clay" in percent format (%), decimal = "." 
- Silt column: "silt" in  format (%), decimal = "." 
- Sand column: "sand" in percent format (%), decimal = "."

## Usage

A simple usage is shown below. for a more in-depth run down of the arguments 
please visit the function help page. 

```{r}

# for demonstration purposes, use path of package
example_file_path <- system.file(package = "miljotools", "/extdata/soil_classify/example.csv")

classify_soil(
  input = example_file_path,
  output = "output_file.csv",
  version = "NOR",
  plot_result = T,
  interactive = T,
  decimal = ".",
  write = FALSE # false just for demonstration. 
)
```
